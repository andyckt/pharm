            <p>
              Pharmacist Yan provides free pharmacy consultations via Facetime to help individuals understand their
              medications, identify potential drug interactions, manage side effects, and answer general medication
              questions. Our services are intended to supplement, not replace, the advice, treatment, or diagnosis from
              your primary healthcare providers.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">Eligibility</h2>

              Our services are available to everyone, with priority given to the elderly (65+), families experiencing
              financial hardship, and residents of underserved communities with limited access to pharmacy services. By
              using our services, you confirm that you are capable of entering into a legally binding agreement.
            </p>
